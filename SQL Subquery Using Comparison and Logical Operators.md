# Subquery
A **Subquery** or Inner query or a Nested query allows us to create complex query on the output of another query
- Sub query syntax involves two SELECT statements
- Syntax:
```sql
SELECT column_name(s) 
FROM table_name 
WHERE column_name **operator** 
( SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE ... );
```
